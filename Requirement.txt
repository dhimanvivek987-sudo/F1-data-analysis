## Steps Performed

1. **Data Loading & Cleaning**  
   - Loaded drivers, constructors, races, results, and circuits CSV files.
   - Merged datasets using driverId, constructorId, raceId, and circuitId.
   - Handled missing values and converted columns to appropriate datatypes.

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**  
   - Top-performing drivers and teams by total points.
   - Points distribution visualization.
   - Bar plots of top 10 drivers and teams.

3. **Driver Segmentation (Clustering)**  
   - Aggregated driver statistics: average points, total points, number of races.
   - Scaled features and applied KMeans clustering to categorize drivers into performance tiers.

4. **Predictive Modeling**  
   - Random Forest Regression to predict points based on year and race position.
   - Time series forecasting using Prophet for top teams’ yearly points.

5. **Visualization**  
   - Matplotlib and Seaborn for bar charts, histograms, and scatter plots.
   - Forecast plots for top teams.
